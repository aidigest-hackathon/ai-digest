Draft Summary: The authors introduce Arctic-TILT, a model that enhances the performance of TILT by introducing a novel modality fusion mechanism inspired by tensor product representations, and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling multi-modal inputs. The model uses a U-Net as an image encoder and combines visual and textual features through a fusion mechanism. The results show that Arctic-TILT outperforms the original TILT and other state-of-the-art models on several benchmarks, including MP-DocVQA and SlideVQA.
Beginner Summary: The authors created a new computer model called Arctic-TILT that combines pictures and text to answer questions better. This model uses a special way of mixing visual and textual information and works well with different types of inputs. Tests show that Arctic-TILT is more accurate than other top models in answering questions about documents and slides.
Intermediate Summary: Arctic-TILT is a model that improves upon the performance of TILT by incorporating a new modality fusion mechanism that combines visual and textual features. This is achieved through the use of a U-Net image encoder and a tensor product-inspired fusion mechanism. By integrating these features, Arctic-TILT demonstrates superior performance compared to the original TILT and other state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks, including MP-DocVQA and SlideVQA.
