Draft Summary: This paper introduces Arctic-TILT, a novel method for synthesizing data using an external data corpus to improve the diversity of the training data. The method is built upon the TILT encoder-decoder model and extends its sequential positional bias with an attention bias based on relative horizontal and vertical distances between each pair of tokens. Additionally, contextualized image embeddings are added to cover the token image region semantics in the context of its entire visual neighborhood. The model uses a U-Net network as an image encoder and a Multi-Head Attention mechanism to combine visual and textual features. The authors also propose a novel modality fusion mechanism inspired by Tensor Product representations, which is used to fuse text and vision modalities.
Beginner Summary: Arctic-TILT is a new way to create diverse training data for computers by combining text and images. It uses a special model that looks at how words and images are related to each other in a scene, and combines them in a way that helps the computer understand the context better. This method can help computers learn more accurately and make better decisions.
Intermediate Summary: Arctic-TILT is a new method for generating diverse training data by leveraging external data sources. It builds on the TILT model, adding attention-based biases to account for spatial relationships between tokens and incorporating contextual image embeddings to capture visual semantics. The model combines visual and textual features using a U-Net network and Multi-Head Attention, and introduces a novel modality fusion mechanism inspired by Tensor Product representations to integrate text and vision modalities.
