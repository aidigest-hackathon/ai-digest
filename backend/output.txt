Draft Summary: The authors propose a novel modality fusion mechanism inspired by tensor product representations, and demonstrate its effectiveness in integrating visual and textual features within each transformer block. They also introduce a new model, Arctic-TILT, which addresses the limitations of the original TILT model by introducing attention sparsity, enhancing the training recipe, and optimizing training and inference. The results show that Arctic-TILT outperforms the original TILT model and other state-of-the-art models on several benchmarks, and can effectively handle long, business documents. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven benchmarks, including MP-DocVQA, DUDE, Kleister Charity, and ArXiv-Lay, and remains competitive with orders of magnitude larger models on other document VQA datasets. The authors also propose several techniques to improve the model's performance, including fusion-in-decoder, nested stack checkpointing, and mixed precision training.
Beginner Summary: Researchers have created a new way to combine pictures and text in computer models, making them better at understanding long documents. They used this new method to build a model called Arctic-TILT, which is an improved version of an earlier model. Arctic-TILT is really good at answering questions about documents, even if they're very long and complicated. In fact, it's one of the best models of its kind, and it's even competitive with much bigger and more powerful models. The researchers also found some new techniques to make the model work even better, which could be useful for other researchers in the future.
Intermediate Summary: The authors present a new approach to combining visual and textual data using a tensor product-inspired modality fusion mechanism, which is integrated into a transformer-based model called Arctic-TILT. This model builds upon the original TILT model by incorporating attention sparsity, enhanced training methods, and optimized training and inference procedures. The results demonstrate that Arctic-TILT surpasses the original TILT model and other state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmarks, particularly excelling with long, business documents. Arctic-TILT achieves top performance on several benchmarks and remains competitive with much larger models on other document VQA datasets. Additionally, the authors introduce several techniques to further improve the model's performance, including fusion-in-decoder, nested stack checkpointing, and mixed precision training.
