Standard natural language processing (NLP)
pipelines operate on symbolic representations
of language, which typically consist of se-
quences of discrete tokens. However, creating
an analogous representation for ancient logo-
graphic writing systems is an extremely labor-
intensive process that requires expert knowl-
edge. At present, a large portion of logographic
data persists in a purely visual form due to
the absence of transcriptionâ€”this issue poses
a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply
NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic lan-
guages: most of the relevant data are images
of writing . This paper investigates whether di-
rect processing of visual representations of lan-
guage offers a potential solution. We introduce
LogogramNLP , the first benchmark enabling
NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages,
featuring both transcribed and visual datasets
for four writing systems along with annotations
for tasks like classification, translation, and
parsing. Our experiments compare systems that
employ recent visual and text encoding strate-
gies as backbones. The results demonstrate that
visual representations outperform textual rep-
resentations for some investigated tasks, sug-
gesting that visual processing pipelines may
unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data
of logographic languages for NLP-based anal-
yses. Data and code are available at https:
