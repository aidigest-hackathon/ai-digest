Draft Summary: The authors propose a method for synthesizing data using an external data corpus for improving the diversity of the TILT encoder-decoder model. They extend the sequential positional bias with an attention bias based on relative horizontal and vertical distances between each pair of tokens, and add contextualized image embeddings that cover the token image region semantics in the context of its entire visual neighborhood. The authors also propose a novel modality fusion mechanism inspired by tensor product representations, and demonstrate how to effectively apply it across the transformer encoder. Additionally, they introduce chunked processing to address the quadratic complexity of self-attention computation in the encoder, and propose attention sparsity patterns and numerous other optimizations to consume extensive input sequences during training and inference, given a single cost-efficient GPU.
Beginner Summary: The authors created a new way to improve a computer model called TILT by adding more variety to the data it uses. They did this by using a separate set of data to help the model learn, and by adding new features that help the model understand images and text better. They also found a way to make the model work more efficiently, so it can handle large amounts of data without needing a lot of computer power.
Intermediate Summary: The authors introduce a new approach to improve the diversity of the TILT encoder-decoder model by generating data from an external corpus. They modify the model's positional bias to account for the spatial relationships between tokens and incorporate image embeddings that capture the context of the surrounding visual information. A novel method for combining different data modalities is also proposed, leveraging tensor product representations. To improve efficiency, the authors implement chunked processing and attention sparsity patterns, enabling the model to handle long input sequences on a single GPU.
