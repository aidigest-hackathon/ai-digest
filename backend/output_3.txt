Draft Summary: The authors introduce the Arctic-TILT model, which addresses TILT's limitations in handling multi-modal input, suboptimal training procedure, and maximum context length. The model uses a novel modality fusion mechanism inspired by tensor product representations and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on seven benchmarks demanding text, vision, and layout comprehension. The model's performance is improved by introducing attention sparsity, enhancing the training recipe, and optimizing training and inference. The authors also evaluate the model's confidence calibration and find that it achieves state-of-the-art results on the DUDE dataset. Additionally, the model is fine-tuned on 17 datasets and achieves competitive results on other document VQA datasets.
Beginner Summary: The Arctic-TILT model is a new computer system that can understand and process different types of input, like text and images, more effectively. It's especially good at understanding documents and answering questions about them. The model is better than previous systems because it combines different types of input in a new way and uses a more efficient training process. It has been tested on many different tasks and has achieved state-of-the-art results, making it a top performer in its field.
Intermediate Summary: The Arctic-TILT model improves upon the original TILT model by incorporating a novel modality fusion mechanism, allowing it to effectively handle multi-modal input. This results in state-of-the-art performance on seven benchmarks that require text, vision, and layout comprehension. The model's performance is further enhanced through the introduction of attention sparsity, optimized training and inference, and an improved training procedure. Evaluations demonstrate that the model achieves state-of-the-art confidence calibration results on the DUDE dataset and competitive results on other document VQA datasets after fine-tuning on 17 datasets.
